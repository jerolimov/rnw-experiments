# React Native for Windows experiments

- Tried different versions of RNW (or RN4W).
- Tried to implement Drag and Drop on different API levels:
  - 0.61.2-with-dnd - Drag and drop in the `ViewViewManager` and `TouchEventHandler` classes / layer
  - 0.61.2-with-dnd2 - Drag and drop in the `ViewManagerBase` and `ShadowNodeBase` classes / layer
  - 0.61.2-with-dnd3 - DnD as custom UI components
- Tested react-native-webview (and react-native-showdown)
